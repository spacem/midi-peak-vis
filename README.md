Download the exe from the releases section on github: https://github.com/spacem/midi-peak-vis/releases

I don't have a code signing certificate so windows will "protect" your PC. Simply click "More info" then "run anyway". All the code is here so feel free to build yourself if you prefer.

This project needs a little polish. If you want to use it and it doesnt work feel free to add an issue to github.

Limitations:
* No configuration
* Only outputs to midi port index 2 - might add a port selector if there is interest
* Only tested on one midi keyboard (my launchkey 49)
* Not really optimised
