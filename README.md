Built to output to my Novation LaunchKey 49

Download the exe from the releases section on github: https://github.com/spacem/midi-peak-vis/releases

This needs a lot of polish but may work for you if you are lucky.

Limitations:
* No configuration
* Only outputs to midi port #2
* Only tested on one keyboard
* Not really optimised
